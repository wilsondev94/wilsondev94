How do I make my Socials and Tech Stack on my GitHub look like the one in the photo?

Edit
I can help you recreate that attractive GitHub profile section with colorful social links and tech stack badges! This appears to be a customized GitHub profile README, which you create by making a special repository that matches your GitHub username.

To create a similar profile with those nice social media buttons and tech stack badges, you'll need to:

Create a repository with the same name as your GitHub username
Add a README.md file to this repository
Use Markdown and HTML to style it similar to the example
Here's how to recreate that look:


GitHub Profile README.md

To make your GitHub profile look like the one in the photo, you need to create a special README file in a repository that matches your GitHub username. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Creating Your Custom GitHub Profile
Create a new repository with the exact same name as your GitHub username
Make it public and check the box to "Initialize this repository with a README"
Edit the README.md file with your custom profile content
How to Recreate the Style
The profile you showed uses shields.io badges for both the social links and tech stack, which gives it that colorful, professional look. I've created a template based on what I see in the image.

The key elements are:

Section emoji icons (üåü, üåê, üíª, üìä)
Shield badges for social links and tech stack
Clean layout with clear sections
What Makes It Look Good
Consistent styling across sections
Color-coded tech badges that match the official colors of each technology
Clean organization with clear headings and sections
Personal touch in the "About Me" section
Feel free to modify the template in the artifact to match your personal information and add or remove tech badges as needed. Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
